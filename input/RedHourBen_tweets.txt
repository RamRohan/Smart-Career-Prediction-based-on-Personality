human side of this issue phil liggett the voice of cycling lets be clear many doctors and the american cancer society guidelines recommend you discuss the test with your doctorthis could be my favorite thing ever my message is that over treatment and early detection are not mutually exclusive one should discuss the test with their doctor you might note the psa test never killed a person and all the negative side affects come from over treatment or other tests xf0x9fx91x8dthis is awesome hey guys respectfully the test is the only though imperfect early detector which saves lives
