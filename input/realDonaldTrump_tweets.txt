news great day for americas future security and safety courtesy of the u s supreme court i will keep fighting for the american people amp win from bombshell in 2016 obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an american election check out his statement witch hunt very grateful for the 9o decision from the u s supreme court we must keep america safe republican senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the democrats not easy perhaps just let ocare crash amp burn under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of t people colluding there is no collusion amp no obstruction i should be given apology the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling with 4 months looking at russia and did not want to rock the boat he didnt choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists they have no policies or ideas all they do is delay and complain they own obamacare hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders is she allowed to so collude unfair to bernie make america great again i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer obama administration official said they choked when it came to acting on russian meddling of election they didnt want to hurt hillary since the obama administration was told way before the 2016 election that the russians were meddling why no action focus on them not t democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums amp

thing not a bad thing only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad we only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are

saw a movement like never beforehillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed will be paid back by mexico later so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers what is going on the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia how did nbc get an exclusive look into the top secret report he obama was presented who gave them this report and why politics toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja mexico to build corolla cars for u s no way build plant in

am in agreement with julian assange wrong i simply state what he states it is for the people time for republicans amp democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive amp far better do the typical political thing and blame the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginning keep you doctor keep your plan it is the democrats lead by head clown

people just dont understand the movementmassive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess it will fall of its own weight be careful like the 116 hike in arizona also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless dont let the schumer clowns out of this web republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases things they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h a total double standard media as usual gave them a pass somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the u s this
