liverpool fans wanting their club to buy ak but a lot of chelsea fans just dont rate also id take nathan ake alongside van dijk long term 3540m would be tough for them to turn down i reckon normal thanks to all the players but ruben today was epic he was ghosting past groups of players freeing up space for wilf loftuscheek was immense today proper south london lad ruben loftuscheek is an outstanding footballer amp needs to be signed i dont care what the fee is rh ruben loftuscheek must have strengthened his chances of being watched by those at england he was exceptional httpherealyorin herealyorin imagine being henk r dont no what to say but get innnnnnnnnnnnnn if ruben loftuscheek played like that on a semiregular basis he would walk into the england starting lineup absolutely another hattrick for mo today just waiting for the other two to be confirmed by the claims panel the moment unbelievable scenes tiny danzel strange how taa can be this good when he hasnt been out on 6 loan moves to middlesbrough charlton birmingham and vitess i love beauty brentford s an assist for mason mount just make me sallieglanvill i have two demands regarding ruben loftuscheek get him on that plane to russia get him back at selhurst next season nathan ake has been phenomena bournemouth will do well to hold onto nathan ake another player chelsea should never have binne nathan ake is quite the talent nathan akes having a stormer here fair play to him nathan ak is phenomenal what can i say were still in this game a very tough game as expected nathan ake has been excellent as always nailed on pla wouldnt mind us trying to sign nathan ake tbh think hes great nathan ake would be the perfect defensive partner for van dijk next season indeed if nothing else perhaps the only silver lining relegation serves is the possibility of coming wonder what itll mean for the likes of reed sims gallagher etc goal for forest brereton 89 11 ipswich will be hoping chelsea dont want loftuscheek back next season hes been v good today dominated the midfield thoughts on the first half fans cant help but feel that palace should be going in with a more comfortable leadluetintednick me neitherbeys on the plane at this rate keep right on loftuscheek is the best player on the pitch and annoyingly glenn murray is the second best wilf fucking hates brighton ruben

dudukutukupunpun poom psealontheloose woo nuno could you give us your reaction from the stands to the last gasp winner please look at the goddamn replies hahahahetgohawks i had jordan houghton and joseph colley too integral parts of my promotion run from the championship oh and wolves are ten points clear at the top of the tabl goal wolves 12 and wolves have won it its ryan bennett can you believe this jured so thats why ive recorded the game cant wait to watch apart from that i can only imagine what a satisfying win some outstanding defensive work by ake today my motm again sa i was pleased with the recovery i thought gylfi was going to get us in front but it was a super tackle from ake lexlang22 whatimmyfunnell1 yeah im not arguing with that one but this seems to be applying to only aina and hector not tomori who is doing alrigh oh hectors really messed that one up hehe love that guyamstapleton im rting too much arent i recall hector and aina please what a shocking miss from gray though nathan ake needs a knighthood cheers enjoyed the game and good feel atmosphere nathan ake was superb nathan ake is a player nathan ak is winning everything for bournmouth at the moment everton struggling going forward centre midfielfders can nathan ake has been great this season but that might be his best 45 minutes his positional sense so far today has been nathan ake is going to be a top class cb his positioning and game awareness is very good already nathan ake a player you kno nathan ake is bos nathan ake needs a knighthood 20million a totally steal class all over the pitch 75million 4 who with a match winning block marry me already huge chance for everton as niasse plays in sigurdsson who should score but is denied by nathan akes challenge the icela 902 nathan ake slices a clearance into the stand nervy last minutes for the cherries 21 nathan ake is a class above fraser and afobe both outstanding today much better without nathan ake wed probably be relegated already nathan ake is far too good for this club hell be at a top 4 club in europe within a year s been consistently praised by even opposition fans this season causation and correlation going out of the window when it comes to loanees is a bit of a theme isnt iocfcws dont forget jamal blackman helped sheff utd to a top three position through the first third of the season after three without

stops playing as he thinks hes fouled kebano referee gives nothing and so he continues drawing a decent stop ayew literally chasing his 1st touch ruining a promising swansea move after a nice find

fuchekralle a lot of dodgy calls huh i see havent been able to catch the game yethekralle hmm werent bournemouth the team with ten men man city the most soft brexit remoaner nancyboys ive seen at filbert street for years diving all over the place and a spa sour grapes aside he was the best player on the pitch nathan ak appreciation tweet lad was superb you are a god is one of the best players ever to play for afcb straight into top 5 no question shoutout to hes the absoue bo an absolutely top class footballer theres got to be someone thinking how the hell did they sell a rather pleasant afternoon at dean court wilson will get all the focus but nathan ake is a different class superb again what a class act is if he put a foot wrong i missed it my love for rapidly reaching arter pitman levels back to his best stunning hatrick was outstanding on the end of everything that went int deserved the pludits for his hattrick but was outstanding at the back and was the reason for a c good to see back to his best although if wasnt at his best at the back i think a few goals wouldv nathan ak is the best player ive ever seen in a bournemouth shirt absolute quality privileged to watch bournemouth at the vitality stadium today callum wilson is the next thierry henry and also nathan nathan akes defensive performance for has been a sight to behol i know callum got mom and im really happy for him after the injuries but was immense again today reflections part ii looks like the absolute steal of the century at 20m thought mcarthur had his best game for ages loftuscheek looked more confident amp cabaye has been most consist loftuscheek vs everton 1 assist 2 key passes 43 passes 86 accuracy 45 successful takeons 13 duels won 6 foujaybose2304 thanks manuuuuuck tough call for motm between wilson and ake today for me i used to think joshua king was the best player at bournemouth nathan ake has been incredible this season play resumes and huddersfield are still looking to get one back but ake is twice on hand to head away 30 understandably callum wilson will get the glory but nathan ake was an absolute rock in defence kept us in the game at tim class result passion in the second half was unbelievable ake and wilson different level nathan ake is fucking unbelievable buzzing for harry arter love you callum if ake cost 20 million what an earth is he worth now the man is unbelievable 45 20 what a tackle from ake to stop going through oneonone with begovic before nathan ake is one of the best centre backs in the league end of both goals have come down s left palace targeting that side at every opportunity loftuscheek v baines has been a loftuscheek with such strength holding off opposition players is a delight to behol now michael keane goes into the book loftuscheek is a problem ruben loftuscheek earned plenty of plaudits for his performance for england last week amp hes at it again this afternoon htt loftuscheek running the midfield at the moment allowed to walk through the centre of the pitch loftus cheek is so hard to defend agains loftuscheek offers so much of what barkley can and should loftus cheek is a balle loftuscheek amp milivojevic
